# environmental-data-analysis

The goal of this project was to analyze environmental data across different biological groups, including bacteria, plants, and eukaryotes, to identify structural differences among these groups and determine which ones exhibit the most variation. Additionally, the project aimed to pinpoint the specific taxons that contribute most significantly to the diversity within these communities. Another key objective was to assess whether the chemical properties of soils differ among three types of ecosystems. 

All analyses were conducted using the PAST (Paleontological Statistics) program.

Analysis: NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling), one-way ANOSIM (analysis of similarities), one-way PERMANOVA (permutational multivariate analysis of variance), SIMPER (similarity percentage), PCA (principal components analysis)
